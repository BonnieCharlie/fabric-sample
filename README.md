# gamenet
 
The prototype was organized to allow two players to play a match together in aP2P setting. Once basic network has been set up, it is possible to run individual tests using Alice or Bob to commit a random string, then redeem alpha and create update transactions to store every new position of the player in game. Using Bob tests it is possible to check Aliceâ€™s updates when he is close to her, from Alice it is possible to do the same.
